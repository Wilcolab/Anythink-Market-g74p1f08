Write a function that converts a given string to camelCase format. The function should handle various word separators such as spaces, underscores, and hyphens, and ensure that the first word is lowercase while each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter. Ignore non-alphanumeric characters except for separators. For example, given the input "convert THIS-string_to camelCase!", the function should return "convertThisStringToCamelCase".
